Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.
Arrow Functions: An arrow function is essentially an anonymous function with a shorter syntax. They are often assigned to variables, making them reusable. Arrow functions are also known as lambda functions in some other programming languages.
Variables (let, const, var): var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
Array Methods: Array methods have different behaviors when encountering empty slots in sparse arrays. In general, older methods (e.g. forEach) treat empty slots differently from indices that contain undefined.
Desstructuring: Destructuring is a technique that allows you to unpack values from arrays or objects into separate variables. This process involves breaking down complex data structures into simpler parts, making it easier to work with them.
Modules: A module in JavaScript is just a file containing related code. In JavaScript, we use the import and export keywords to share and receive functionalities respectively across different modules.
Tenary Operator:  The ternary operator is a conditional operator which evaluates either of two expressions, a true expression and a false expression.
